# 1) The Application

The name of the application I'm building will be called RaceLabs. RaceLabs is a terminal application that allows the user to place a bet on a particular horse race. The user will have the opportunity to select a race of his/her choice, look at the form of the horse. The option to go even deeper and look at what races the the horse has been in the past. Select the horse. Select an amount wish to be staked and finnally the opportunity to make a bet and recieve a recipet of transaction.

After visiting the racecourse I noticed there was a market for the bookmakers to put their operations onto the phone. Big line ups. Confused punters and techonological advancments lead me to believe a phone app would not only help the bookmaker, but enhance the overall experience of the race goer. The application although destined for the phone will be first made in Ruby. This way it can be tested in a number of ways before it makes its invietable cross to the smart phone.

Target Audience obvisoulsy is anyone interested in making a bet. Narrowing it down it will aimed at 18-40 year old males who are more technologically gifted. There will however be a strong push to get females involved. There role in the industry is vital. With the help of the user guide and help instructions females will be empowered with the app. 

# 2) Features

1) First feature will be the main page of the terminal pplication. It will interact with the user to get details like name and age. Anyone under the age of 18 will not be allowed to bet. This will be written into the code and will basically shut down if found to be true. The username will be remember and will be recalled throughout the app. On the main page the user will have the options of selecting what race that wish to place a bet on.

2) Second feature is the race form. Once the user has selected the race the user will then be able to look at the horses form before placing a bet. The user will select the form and information about the horse will appear on the screen. The user will then have an opprtunity to dig deeper and discover a history of its last 3 performances

3) The last feature will be the betting slip. Here the user can interact with app by selecting the horse they wish to bet on. From there the user can select how much this wish to stake. 
The app will allow the user to place multiple bets. Oncce finished selcting the horse and stake amounts the bet will be placed a reciept of tranaction will be produced.

4) Will add color through gem files. Gives a nicer feel and also gives the user a better experience

# 3) User Experience

When developing the application ease of use and simplicity was kept in mind. Users will be prompt with simple questions to get around the programme. They will be given letters to enter into the terminal aloowing them to move around the site. The programme will have messages displayed at all times to make the user aware they have the option to either exit the programme or contiue on. In the form guide section they will have the ability to further investigate a horse's form. If the user gets confused with terminology they will be directed to the help menu, where they can seek legends to help the user out. If wrong commands are entered, simple error message will be introduced, notifying the user to select a different option.
