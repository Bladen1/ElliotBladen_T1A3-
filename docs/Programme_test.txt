Test 1

Test 1 was to see if I could make a simple bet. No form reading, No nothing. Just a simple in out experience. Going through my flow chart. It was > Select race 1 > Select my Stake > Select my Horse > Print my receipt. All the functions worked.

Test 2

Test 2 was to make a simple bet by pressing wrong numbers and letters. The programme handled this effectively through loops. It did not crash. The user still had clear instructions on the screen that were easy to understand.


Test 3

Test 3 was to test out the form area. Making sure everything worked efficiently and effectively. All functions worked. All instructions easy to understand. Programme informative for the user wishing to make a bet
